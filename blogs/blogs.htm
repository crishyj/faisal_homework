                <h2> Tips for Building High-Quality Django Apps at Scale</h2>
            </a>
            <cite>by Mohammed Adel, 12/10/2017</cite>
            <p>
                At DoorDash, most of our backend is currently based in Django and Python. The scrappy Django codebase
                from our early days has evolved and matured over the years as our business has grown. To continue to
                scale, we’ve also started to migrate our monolithic app towards a microservices architecture. We’ve
                learned a lot about what works well and what doesn’t with Django, and hope we can share some useful tips
                on how to work with this popular web framework.

                <h2> Test Driven Development with Django</h2>
            </a>
            <cite>by Lewis Kabui, 5/5/2019</cite>
            <p>Test Driven Development is a software development technique where tests are written first and then the
                source code is written thereafter. Its workflow can be summarised by the following bullet points;
                Tests should be written first — The tests cannot pass because the source code they are meant to test
                does not exist yet at this point.
                Source code is written to deliver the requirements that are expected in the tests.
                The tests are run.
                If they pass, this means that the source code meets the requirements that were defined in the tests.
                If the tests do not pass, the source code is refactored to meet the requirements.
                Repeat the steps above for every test.</p>
